# Pulse+ADC capture and report utility

Adapted from the https://github.com/pedvide/ADC/tree/master/examples/analogContinuousRead code from the Teensy ADC library https://github.com/pedvide/ADC.

This code adds three new commands:

1) 'p' -- Pulse and start sampling ADC
2) 'd' -- Report the sampled data
3) 'm' -- Metadata on the sample
